4,garster25,"Not for the move-in part. And you only get 1 parking pass (you can pay for parking for the other).

Santa Catalina has 2 stages since they took out the parking lot to build San Joaquin.

First stage is at a warehouse (where the Munger Hall mockup is) out on Storke road. At that point you get checked in and we vet you with the ""parking pass"" you got/will get in the mail.

The second stage is on the side of the road out front were you unload, drop your stuff in your room then get outta there. We wont let two cars got to stage 2, and if the second care shows up they will kick them out since that spot can be used by someone else.

Many students say goodbye at this point and stay put as their families leave, others leave and cruise around with their families and came back later in the evening.

Thousands of cars piling thru that weekend, we need as few as possible and get them in and out as soon as possible. There is just no room, it is a circus.

If you are bringing two cars for all the people it is best not to, say goodbye at home then bring 1 or 2 other people. But if the second car is coming anyways have them hang out somewhere away from campus while you move in, then go meet them away from campus.",2022-09-10 21:35:38+00:00,t1_inworg9,t3_xaltqq,UCSantaBarbara,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/xaltqq/move_in_day_question/inworg9/,,,

22,just-a-parent,"Singles would be great. I don’t think anyone denies that. UCSB signed an agreement committing to only doubles (with some minimal construction exceptions) in a long range development plan, but UCSB ignored their promises to build on campus property. Now, the situation is so dire that even this crazy plan seems ok. It shouldn’t be, and they should be forced to go back to their original plan. 

Sleeping in darkness is also healthy and improves sleep quality.

But exposure to natural, broad spectrum light is also healthy upon wakening, and this wouldn’t be available to the 4000-5000 students until they both left the bedroom/bathroom and common pod area. That delay means reduced hours of lighting (and a delayed phase) compared to kids who have curtains they can open or even light exposure from a bathroom or kitchen/dining window. Is it ok for 500, 1000, or maybe more students to experience reduced sleep quality (brought on by phase changes), depression, or reduced cognitive ability? If we could know a priori which students would be resistant to the effects of Munger Hall, maybe a case could be made for it, but we don’t have a way to do that. 

This also ignores the insane cost of Munger — comparing apples to apples prepandemic pricing, it comes at a record-breaking price per bed. 

The building also has what are some really poor choices. The shower situation doesn’t seem much improved from dorms (8 students per shower). This is adopted so you can have pod kitchens, but given that there is so much non-pod common space, too, wouldn’t this room be better spent in providing more bathrooms or even some kind of light/ventilation access?",2022-08-01 22:31:29+00:00,t1_iikgrat,t3_wdiins,UCSantaBarbara,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/wdiins/there_are_worse_things_than_munger_hall/iikgrat/,,,

30,Downtown_Cabinet7950,"This will be another unpopular post because group think is so strong these days.

The mental health response of lack of light is not uniform through the population. I grew up at the 54th parallel. At the winter solstice our sun rose at 9am and set at 4pm. You could put as many damn windows on my bedroom as possible, I wasn't getting natural light when I got home from school. The summer/winter solstice is part of the culture there. Some people have intense mental responses. Some have none. I was in the none camp. 

In fact my mental health due to lack sleep got MUCH worse when I moved to to 30th parallel for UG. I am EXTREMELY noise sensitive and sharing a room with two people was torture for me (snoring, different sleep schedules, etc.). I also like studying in common areas. I would chose Munger Hall over a conventional dorm 100 times. I would combat the pod feeling and lack of natural light by only spending my sleeping hours in my pod. 

The thing is, this is a benefit to everyone. If I choose Munger (which is my choice and true preference), that frees up a bed in a conventional dorm. 

For a Research University, we sure like to throw around ""years of research"" and ""well studied"" without actually citing shit. Here is a Peer Reviewed article from 2022 from the Journal of Sleep Research. It actually finds the exact opposite ""A greater cumulative light exposure over ≥1 year was associated with a shorter sleep duration (β = −0.10, 95% confidence interval \[CI\] −0.15 to −0.04), more sleep problems (incident rate ratio \[IRR\] 1.04, 95% CI 1.0–1.07) and diurnal preference towards eveningness (β = −0.09, 95% CI −0.14 to −0.03). ""

100,just-a-parent,"While some kids will be ok without natural lighting, there *will* be a decent amount of students affected by lack of natural light. There are decades of sleep research that show how important lighting is for mood (the more outwardly obvious effect) but also general health, so even some of the students not obviously affected might actually have other health effects. 

Munger has proposed a light in the rooms that supposedly will mimic natural light, but apparently it was too expensive to have this automated, so it would need to be manually turned on. First, no one has tested if his artificial light (automated or manual) proposed really works enough to prevent health issues, and secondly, the manual light will still affect sleep cycle since it won’t come on early enough for late-shifted sleepers etc. 

Also, think about if you wake up at 3am in your current dorm/apartment — you know it’s not time to get up simply by it being dark, ie no sliver of light coming in your window. Without natural light cues, our bodies are disoriented. Many of your cells, it turns out, aren’t getting the right cues either.

I agree that many students would love a small single, but at what cost to student health? Out of the 4500 occupants, there would be hundreds with obvious issues if not more, and Munger Hall is planned primarily for freshmen, so the students housed there are already experiencing the stress from transitioning to college. 

If Munger continues as proposed, I think it will be a legal problem down the road when a chunk of students start having problems.",2022-02-25 07:09:45+00:00,t1_hycpydt,t1_hy9rmao,UCSantaBarbara,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/t0gyrx/what_is_so_bad_about_munger_halls/hycpydt/,,,

The justification is that you have your own desk and room in your munger hall dorm, but then you are undermining the idea that it will be a community environment, and most people will move out after their freshman year, so they will be forced to study at home etc. It is a very poorly planned way to solve an issue and basically reflects a strategy to collect tuition and fix problems later.",2022-02-24 19:21:42+00:00,t1_hya2y81,t1_hya03hw,UCSantaBarbara,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/t0gyrx/what_is_so_bad_about_munger_halls/hya2y81/,,,

111,Downtown_Cabinet7950,"There are many regulatory hurdles Munger Hall would need to overcome. This would only remove portions of CEQA as it relates to enrollment numbers.

Specially, it would disallow treating students as sources of pollution. The building itself would still need to be assessed for environment impacts (on top of all potential code issues and other regulatory issues).

Enrollment is a tricky one. The state hasn’t built enough UCs to keep up with population increases. With limited budget, increasing existing UC enrollment is no doubt the more cost efficient option. Other options like banning OOS enrollment or international students has an impact on the prestige of the UC system (you want the best global minds and you want diverse backgrounds/experiences).

I agree with the law. Treating enrollment increases as environmental damage is BS. If those students don’t attend Berkeley, they will attend another school. I’m Enviromental policy we call this leakage.

Neighborhoods should have some say in how their local university impacts their town, but they shouldn’t bastardize an environmental act to do so.

It's really easy to withdrawal, links are attached. And as long you are in good standing (2.0 and no fees due) you can very easily return to UCSB in the future by filling out a readmission form. If you have under a 2.0 it would be a reinstatement and requires a letter.... isn't a guarantee but there is always path back.

My advice would be to take GE's at the CC, not classes for your major. And make sure to speak with a counselor in your college before hand.

273,AdvancedTip1672,"I didn’t say to use the donors money to fix Wi-Fi. I said to use the money saved by the school, thanks to the donor, to fix Wi-Fi. Here’s an example:

The school has $10 and wants to buy a new building for $8 and wants to fix the Wi-Fi for $4. They need $2 which they will try to raise funding for through one of two ways:

Option 1: ask donors for $2 to fix Wi-Fi.

Option 2: ask donors for $2 for a building which they can put their name on.

Which do you think is more attractive to a donor? If you were the school which would you pick to make it more likely you get the $2 you need? Either way they now have $12 and can buy both. 

If option 1 they can use the $2 from the donor and $2 of their own to fix Wi-Fi and still have $8 leftover to build the building. If option 2 they can use the $2 from the donor and $6 of their own to build the building and still have $4 left over for wifi.

Either way their complying with their restrictions are they not? I don’t understand how people can complain about FREE MONEY. Would you rather have $10 or $12? The building needs to get built and wifi needs to get fixed.

319,Horseshoe_Crab,"It's not just the windows. The real reason is that Munger Hall is an example of UCSB being run like a business at the expense of the quality of the student experience. The lack of windows is a talking point because it contrasts what students love about UCSB — great social life, central coast beaches — versus what the university is providing: cramped singles with a prison-like layout and no natural light.

I'm actually not sure Munger Hall gives opportunity for more underprivileged people to attend UCSB, it just gives the opportunity for more people to attend UCSB, full stop. Remember, the housing crisis was *created* by the university administration. The university gets more money from having more students, especially out-of-state and international students that pay higher tuition. Munger Hall is a way for the university to get 4,500 more tuitions in their pocket without having to pay full price for the building.

The nail in the coffin, for me at least, is the way negotiations went down. Munger wants final say on the design for donating $200MM for a $1.5 billion project. That's still $1.3 billion out of pocket for the residence hall, you're telling me there's no better way that money could be spent on a design more in line with what the students, who will actually have to live there, want? I hate that my school is being bought out by the highest bidder. I wish the administration was strong enough to say ""we are a public university with an obligation to our students, we cannot accept a donation with large strings attached"".

By building Munger Hall, the university is saying ""we don't care about finding the best solution; we dug ourselves into a hole and want the cheapest and quickest way out"".

367,mattskee,"I don't really know. Part of an alternative might have been to build higher density in the preceding years... the most recent undergrad dorm built by the University is Manzanita Village. Compare that with the Munger megadorm. The two projects are lightyears apart in density and design philosophy. 

UCSB is somewhat painted into a corner, but building a bad project to get out of it is not the answer. Maybe they need to go back to the state and lower the enrollment cap. Or ask the state for funds to build housing in a way that is in character with the campus and will support the students in their education.

OR, if they do want to go through with this unproven concept... they need to actually study if it works, i.e. if it leads to poor outcomes for a lot of the students. So at the very minimum if this building is a $1.5B mistake, negatively impacting some fraction of 4500 students per year for decades, they should find out and not repeat it on other UC campuses if it was a mistake.  Of course that will never happen, big organizations never make mistakes (or at least never want to find out that they did).

That's one big issue with UM's Munger Hall: it doesn't seem as if they studied if it led to good outcomes. Because UM's Munger Hall exists, whether or not it worked well, it's being used as a justification for UCSB's Munger dorm.",2021-11-02 19:28:29+00:00,t1_hj1sphx,t1_hj14wmv,UCSantaBarbara,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/ql6oi1/dear_uc_santa_barbara_dont_let_a_petulant/hj1sphx/,,,

475,Anti-Munger,"There is an RCO called Students for Equitable Housing that was created not to long ago to 

1.	Protest the monstrosity that is munger hall
2.	establish a commission comprised of students and faculty so make sure that everyone has a voice represented when it comes to future discussion of housing. 

Number two is especially important since it is now confirmed that all the commisions were justs farces to approve the disasterous designs of a real estate speculator. We must ensure that all people at ucsb get a fair shake when it comes to housing. 


Our kickoff meeting is soon, we just need to reserve a room and finalize some things.  Stay tuned and keep an eye out for flyers on campus which will have more information.",2021-10-28 16:37:25+00:00,t1_hiee3w5,t3_qhgfwu,UCSantaBarbara,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/qhgfwu/if_someone_were_to_hypothetically_publicly/hiee3w5/,,,

That building houses 4000 students, and is composed of multiple wings wrapped around multiple courtyards with over 25 entrances. Munger Hall, in comparison, is a single block housing 4500 students ***with two entrances.***""

479,SJshield616,"God damn...I knew just by looking at the concepts that Munger Hall would be a bad idea, but I was never aware of the actual hard numbers. Mr. McFadden is right on all counts. That would be a disaster for UCSB.

On top of being an architectural trainwreck, Munger Hall makes zero sense from an engineering perspective as well. Giant buildings are great for minimizing heating costs and protecting people from the elements, which makes them great for dealing with harsh East Coast and Midwestern winters. That logic does not apply here in sunny California. Notice that every dorm and apartment here has large panoramic windows that let in plenty of natural light, and more importantly cool air flow that negate the need for expensive air conditioning. Buildings are also narrow and sprawling so they'd contain less heat and ventilate better. Munger Hall would need year-round industrial grade air conditioning that would tank our campus' environmental sustainability rating.",2021-10-26 22:15:22+00:00,t1_hi67yy5,t3_qgcx6h,UCSantaBarbara,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/qgcx6h/dennis_mcfadden_consulting_architect_of_the/hi67yy5/,,,
