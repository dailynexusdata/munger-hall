&gt;The LRDP was an attempt to negotiate an orderly path by which UCSB could gradually increase enrollments from 20,000 students to 25,000. Beyond the additional 5,000 students, the agreement allows the campus to expand by 336 faculty members and 1,400 staff. To date, the campus has built 1,500 new units of housing. **That’s 3,500 short of the agreement**. In the past, the campus has argued that it hasn’t really exceeded the 25,000 mark, pointing out there are always 10 percent fewer students in the spring than when they enroll in the fall. In addition, they have until 2025 to build the housing.

&gt;In the past few years, Chancellor Henry Yang has highlighted the massive dormitory promised by billionaire investor Charlie Munger, known alternately as Munger Hall or “Dormzilla.” **As initially designed, the dorm would stand 11 stories off the ground and house approximately 4,500 students**.

So the newer, lower amount of housing at this massive build is the minimum per the agreement. That must mean USCB won’t increase enrollment… right? Ha.",t1_iqmzfjt
2,RexJoey1999,2022-10-01 16:05:43+00:00,t1_iqmzfjt,,,SantaBarbara,,https://old.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/xsz08p/ucsb_pulls_back_curtain_on_giant_munger_residence/iqmzfjt/,"&gt;The nine-story project, which would cover three acres near Harder Stadium and the UCSB Police station, is not a done deal, and still requires approvals from the University of California Board of Regents and the California Coastal Commission.

&gt;An environmental impact report for Munger Hall is nearing completion, according to Gene Lucas, a retired UCSB executive vice chancellor who is helping shepherd the project. The report then will go to the office of UC President Michael V. Drake for review and input, Lucas said, and be put out for public comment by the end of October.

&gt;The project could be approved as early as the summer of 2023, Lucas said. Construction would take about 40 months to complete, meaning the residence facility could be open as early as 2026.

**New info to me:**
&gt;Original plans for the structure had 11 floors, but that has been trimmed down to nine, Lucas said. That would make it taller than the Santa Catalina dorm twin towers in Isla Vista (the former Francisco Torres), but not taller than the university's iconic Storke Tower. 
Under the latest design, the complex would house 3,500 students instead of the previous plan for 4,500 students. None of them will be first-year students, Lucas said. According to Lucas, this change was mainly due to sustainability reasons.  “It uses less resources in terms of water, power, less trash, and then also is a better fit from the airport's point of view,” Lucas said.

**Gotta hold them to this:
&gt;The cost of living in Munger Hall is targeted to be 20% below market for the area, Lucas said. He gave a rough estimate for rent of between $850 and $900 a month by the time it opens.**",t3_xsz08p

I literally just did a tour (which has been open to staff, faculty, and students since last year) and they specifically said this is intended more for continuing students who often find themselves without housing or clambering for expensive IV rentals after their freshman year. 
And freshmen just started- they might not even know about munger hall. 
“Staff who have never even lived in dorms” aren’t being given more consideration. We aren’t the reason it’s being built or have any influence in the matter. We were just given an opportunity to see it (and that doesn’t mean none of us lived in dorms. A lot of UCSB add are ucsb alums who lives literally in the same dorms as current students.)

We agree on one thing though- students SHOULD go see if. Exactly why they sent out these target emails with opportunities for tours outside of normal business hours. So that they conflict less with classes.",t1_iqh7fgn

Yea some natural light came in, but never direct sunlight. The only reason I ever had that window open was to let cool air in at night. I just never studied or did much in that room besides watch YouTube or sleep. I sleep with an eye cover because light can come into my windows at night, (which js good for you anyway, ambient light at night can also affect your sleep.) 

You can wake up and walk outside and get light to wake you up and keep your circadian rhythm check. 

Munger hall is an imperfect solution I will admit, but it is nonetheless a solution to the housing shortage. I’m not saying you can’t complain about, but people just hear “NO WINDOWS” And then freak out and don’t think for 2 seconds",t1_iqfi7yi

just go outside. We have the nicest weather on Earth. Study at the lib. Go to class. Eat at the dining hall. Hangout on the beach or in a green space. It’s only one year. Make friends with people who live in IV. It’s only one year. Your mental health will only be affected by munger hall if you spend a lot of time in your room, which is not good for you anyways (excluding sleeping ofc).",t3_xrhjp6

I imagine you and your colleagues would be better off if you got more money, maybe some of the more than $175 MM the system kept hidden while asking for more taxpayer money.  

To quote the Wikipedia article, because they cite sources and I’m too lazy to do that on mobile, “On August 9, 2016 Katehi resigned her position as Chancellor of the University, but retained her position as a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and is allowed to have the title ""chancellor emerita"". She received a full year of paid sabbatical (paying her $424,360 for the year) with instruction responsibilities to start in the Fall of 2017. The resignation was a deal approved by UC President Janet Napolitano. Katehi stated that she would use her time to write ""a memoir about her experiences as a woman in the electrical engineering field and as an administrative figure"".

In other words, the chancellor who oversaw the whole debacle and tried to cover it up with university money is still on Davis’ staff, and *[Janet Napolitano](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Auditor-rips-UC-for-keeping-millions-in-secret-11097470.php)* cut her an absolute sweetheart deal (roughly $425k) to disappear for a year! Don’t worry, Katehi is back to teaching…one course a semester. Here’s her [UC Davis faculty page](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/directory/linda-katehi).

But let’s operate on the idea that Napolitano is gone, so let’s just look at what UC leadership is doing now. At UCSB, they’re spending way more than usual to build a prison complex on one of the most beautiful stretches of the planet and calling it a dorm, and they’re using that terrible design because a billionaire gave them $200MM on the condition that they use his windowless design. The thing is, comparable units (in capacity and footprint) built across the UC system cost less than 2/3 the $1 billion plus that Murder Hall (officially it’s called Munger Hall but we all know the truth because [there’s more than enough evidence that a similar building in Michigan raised depression rates among other issues](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/02/business/munger-residences-michigan-windowless/index.html)), which means the UC is spending more money for a worse product. Watch the video I linked, I’m quite sure there’s some good crossover with BTB. My favorite part is [UCSB trying to tout the lower cost compared to Isla Vista](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2022/020643/experience-munger-hall-model-house) (the neighboring community where college kids live if they’re not in Residence Halls/dorms) as though it’s comparable to sharing a room *when there are no windows and there’s literally a pandemic*. Oh, and there’s no car parking and insufficient bike storage for the 4,500 expected residents, even though the nearest full grocery store is miles away and all the mini-stores closer have heavy markups on essentials like sanitary products for women. But hey, that’s only two schools, there are 10 total (if you count UCSF which I believe only does medical school). Maybe the other eight are free of such stupid thinking at every level of leadership and have good relationships with their neighboring communities.",t1_inwqz82

Santa Catalina has 2 stages since they took out the parking lot to build San Joaquin.

First stage is at a warehouse (where the Munger Hall mockup is) out on Storke road. At that point you get checked in and we vet you with the ""parking pass"" you got/will get in the mail.

The second stage is on the side of the road out front were you unload, drop your stuff in your room then get outta there. We wont let two cars got to stage 2, and if the second care shows up they will kick them out since that spot can be used by someone else.

Many students say goodbye at this point and stay put as their families leave, others leave and cruise around with their families and came back later in the evening.

Thousands of cars piling thru that weekend, we need as few as possible and get them in and out as soon as possible. There is just no room, it is a circus.

If you are bringing two cars for all the people it is best not to, say goodbye at home then bring 1 or 2 other people. But if the second car is coming anyways have them hang out somewhere away from campus while you move in, then go meet them away from campus.",t3_xaltqq

I don’t think anyone denies that. UCSB signed an agreement committing to only doubles (with some minimal construction exceptions) in a long range development plan, but UCSB ignored their promises to build on campus property. Now, the situation is so dire that even this crazy plan seems ok. It shouldn’t be, and they should be forced to go back to their original plan. 

Sleeping in darkness is also healthy and improves sleep quality.

But exposure to natural, broad spectrum light is also healthy upon wakening, and this wouldn’t be available to the 4000-5000 students until they both left the bedroom/bathroom and common pod area. That delay means reduced hours of lighting (and a delayed phase) compared to kids who have curtains they can open or even light exposure from a bathroom or kitchen/dining window. Is it ok for 500, 1000, or maybe more students to experience reduced sleep quality (brought on by phase changes), depression, or reduced cognitive ability? If we could know a priori which students would be resistant to the effects of Munger Hall, maybe a case could be made for it, but we don’t have a way to do that. 

This also ignores the insane cost of Munger — comparing apples to apples prepandemic pricing, it comes at a record-breaking price per bed. 

The building also has what are some really poor choices. The shower situation doesn’t seem much improved from dorms (8 students per shower). This is adopted so you can have pod kitchens, but given that there is so much non-pod common space, too, wouldn’t this room be better spent in providing more bathrooms or even some kind of light/ventilation access?",t3_wdiins

The mental health response of lack of light is not uniform through the population. I grew up at the 54th parallel. At the winter solstice our sun rose at 9am and set at 4pm. You could put as many damn windows on my bedroom as possible, I wasn't getting natural light when I got home from school. The summer/winter solstice is part of the culture there. Some people have intense mental responses. Some have none. I was in the none camp. 

In fact my mental health due to lack sleep got MUCH worse when I moved to to 30th parallel for UG. I am EXTREMELY noise sensitive and sharing a room with two people was torture for me (snoring, different sleep schedules, etc.). I also like studying in common areas. I would chose Munger Hall over a conventional dorm 100 times. I would combat the pod feeling and lack of natural light by only spending my sleeping hours in my pod. 

The thing is, this is a benefit to everyone. If I choose Munger (which is my choice and true preference), that frees up a bed in a conventional dorm. 

For a Research University, we sure like to throw around ""years of research"" and ""well studied"" without actually citing shit. Here is a Peer Reviewed article from 2022 from the Journal of Sleep Research. It actually finds the exact opposite ""A greater cumulative light exposure over ≥1 year was associated with a shorter sleep duration (β = −0.10, 95% confidence interval \[CI\] −0.15 to −0.04), more sleep problems (incident rate ratio \[IRR\] 1.04, 95% CI 1.0–1.07) and diurnal preference towards eveningness (β = −0.09, 95% CI −0.14 to −0.03). ""

&gt; Munger, the 97-year-old vice chairman of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, donated $200 million to UCSB to fund the dorms, with the caveat that his designs are followed.

The only thing that got me out of my dorm was escaping all my roommates, so I can't even imagine what things would've been like if I could've holed myself up in a little single, especially one with no windows or anything.

He's not even the worst. A lot of the Forbes 400 set are disappointingly petty, small minded fools who are completely insulated from reality by their wealth and status. I see people on the sub saying things like, ""Don't forget, the ruling classes may be greedy, but they aren't stupid or shortsighted,"" a lot and like, some of them are Dugins or Rees-Moggs, but a lot of them are just mediocre morons with more power than anyone should have.",t1_i66yly1

I'd have to sanitize it constantly if I wanted to keep using it for washing vegetables etc. And I'd have to open the door to the bathroom with those dirty hands and then walk over to the kitchen sink, too. I just don't see why you couldn't have sinks back to back on the same wall instead. 

There are actually subdivided flats in the world that are only 18 square feet. It's better than nothing, but I think that's like saying eating rats is better than starving. Like I said, I am all for tiny houses, I wish I could buy one, and a parking spot-sized residence would be fine for one person, but I know unfortunately there are families in the world that have to live in such crowded spaces. And, like I said in my last comment, a billionaire in California is literally planning to cram 4,000 students into a mostly windowless dorm that he designed and named after himself (""Munger Hall""), causing the architect to quit in protest: ""He described each apartment as a ""sealed"" environment, and likened it to “living in a janitor’s closet buried at the center of an Ikea warehouse, with the closest window somewhere back at the entrance.” 

Munger was quoted as saying he'd “rather be a billionaire and not be loved by everybody than not have any money.”

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna4401

And that's what I'm afraid of, billionaires deciding that an inhumane amount of space is perfectly acceptable for the masses no matter what the condition; they'll be happy to take our concern for the environment and/or our desperation and use it against us. So yes, we should downsize, but not to the point that we're being flattened while the rich stand on us.",t1_i62blu9

The curriculum is gonna be quite different for CE and CS+statistics. In the latter, you'll take all of the fundamental CS courses, and several stats classes as your technicals. As a CE (based on uiuc's curriculum because I don't know UCSB's very well), you'll take the fundamental CS courses, computer architecture courses, as well as a few electrical engineering courses (which people interested in software engineering tend to despise).

If you are not interested in computer hardware systems, don't pursue CE. This should probably be your primary deciding factor.

I imagine that the coursework is largely gonna be similar for both schools for CS classes. The rankings do not come from coursework for the most part, but rather from things like research output and having more accomplished faculty (who are probably not even going to be teaching you for most classes). From the people I know at UCSB, the CS courses aren't any more or less difficult at either school.

TLDR:
Choose UCSB CE if you want to learn about and work with computer hardware systems, and you want to do homework on the beach in the middle of February. Also note that housing is way harder to find and more expensive at UCSB, pray that you don't have to live at [Munger Hall](https://www-independent-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.independent.com/2021/10/28/architect-resigns-in-protest-over-ucsb-mega-dorm/?amp=1&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;amp_js_v=a9&amp;usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;aoh=16503260049944&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.com%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2Farchitect-resigns-in-protest-over-ucsb-mega-dorm%2F)

There are decades of sleep research that show how important lighting is for mood (the more outwardly obvious effect) but also general health, so even some of the students not obviously affected might actually have other health effects. 

Munger has proposed a light in the rooms that supposedly will mimic natural light, but apparently it was too expensive to have this automated, so it would need to be manually turned on. First, no one has tested if his artificial light (automated or manual) proposed really works enough to prevent health issues, and secondly, the manual light will still affect sleep cycle since it won’t come on early enough for late-shifted sleepers etc. 

Also, think about if you wake up at 3am in your current dorm/apartment — you know it’s not time to get up simply by it being dark, ie no sliver of light coming in your window. Without natural light cues, our bodies are disoriented. Many of your cells, it turns out, aren’t getting the right cues either.

I agree that many students would love a small single, but at what cost to student health? Out of the 4500 occupants, there would be hundreds with obvious issues if not more, and Munger Hall is planned primarily for freshmen, so the students housed there are already experiencing the stress from transitioning to college. 

If Munger continues as proposed, I think it will be a legal problem down the road when a chunk of students start having problems.",t1_hy9rmao

The justification is that you have your own desk and room in your munger hall dorm, but then you are undermining the idea that it will be a community environment, and most people will move out after their freshman year, so they will be forced to study at home etc. It is a very poorly planned way to solve an issue and basically reflects a strategy to collect tuition and fix problems later.",t1_hya03hw

This would only remove portions of CEQA as it relates to enrollment numbers.

Specially, it would disallow treating students as sources of pollution. The building itself would still need to be assessed for environment impacts (on top of all potential code issues and other regulatory issues).

Enrollment is a tricky one. The state hasn’t built enough UCs to keep up with population increases. With limited budget, increasing existing UC enrollment is no doubt the more cost efficient option. Other options like banning OOS enrollment or international students has an impact on the prestige of the UC system (you want the best global minds and you want diverse backgrounds/experiences).

I agree with the law. Treating enrollment increases as environmental damage is BS. If those students don’t attend Berkeley, they will attend another school. I’m Enviromental policy we call this leakage.

Neighborhoods should have some say in how their local university impacts their town, but they shouldn’t bastardize an environmental act to do so.

In March 2016, Munger announced a further $200 million gift to UC Santa Barbara, conditioned on the university’s commitment to spend it on an undergraduate dormitory of Munger’s own unconventional design preferences, notably windowless bedrooms and common areas, while tripling the record gift he gave for the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.[50][51] In October, 2021, Munger's insistence that the university follow his design compelled professional architect, Dennis McFadden, who had served the university for two decades, to resign from the university's Design Review Committee. McFadden stated that the windowless, 1.68-million-square-foot dormitory would be “'unsupportable from my perspective as an architect, a parent, and a human being.... An ample body of documented evidence shows that interior environments with access to natural light, air, and views to nature improve both the physical and mental wellbeing of occupants.... The Munger Hall design ignores this evidence and seems to take the position that it doesn’t matter.... [T]he building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves",t3_su3wu9

There are freshmen who would want to live off campus, and there are upperclassmen who want to live on campus. The main policy keeping these 2 populations from living where they want is the UNT Division of Student Affairs (DSA) first-year residency policy. Housing just enforces what their leadership 2 levels above them say they need to do. DSA cites studies on the retention and success metrics for first year students as their reasoning for keeping and enforcing the policy. 

Each year the problem is worsened by Admissions opening floodgates and letting in more students than ever before. More seats filled, more money, more students potentially returning beyond year 1… but the amount of upperclassmen housing available decreases.

It’s not cheap or quick to build a new residence hall. And the board members who set Admissions targets each year aren’t likely to consider decreasing the numbers.

So unless some rich UNT alumnus decides to donate millions of dollars to the university specifically to build a windowless Dormzilla like UC’s Munger Hall, DSA could reduce a lot of the demand by",t3_ssgwzd

Preface what I am about to say with this - by all standards Munger Hall is an abomination of architectural design.

I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/sl172y/billionaire_defends_windowless_dorm_rooms_for/hvp4web/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3](this comment) and got downvoted to oblivion for saying the interviewer sounded disrespectful in the CBC article, when they were clearly patronizing the man by asking obvious questions: “But you’re not an architect, are you?”, “You didn’t live in a windowless dorm, did you?”

Right or wrong, that’s not how you talk to people, and that’s not how we reach solutions. And I know Munger has been crass in interviews and he is saying take it or leave it, but he’s not making anyone do anything. He is offering one solution to the university’s problem, and right now the administration thinks it’s the best option. And as far as a I know, there are no other viable options on the table. And besides, the architecture community doesn’t have to sink to his level.

The fact that a simple comment like the one I made will be buried by downvotes and go unread I feel is a symptom of a deeper issue.

*Then they came for the rec cen, and I did not speak out—*

*Because I was not a gym rat.*

*Then they raised Chancellor Yang’s salary. From $451,362 to $579,750 to be exact. And I could be silent no more…*

The history of the present Chancellor Yang is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over this campus. To prove this, let these facts be submitted to all fellow Gauchos:

&amp;#x200B;

* He has decided to announce online classes for nearly half of the quarter for the same price of tuition as in-person classes, conveniently only days after BARC payments were due.
* He has chosen to financially and morally support a dorm that will without doubt degrade the mental health of the students living in it.
* He has shirked the responsibility of choosing to remain online over to the professors.
* He has limited the services we pay thousands of dollars in tuition for and still demands we pay full cost.
* He has refused to acknowledge the grievances of the staff and students that make up the campus he serves.
* And he has been rewarded for his impunity with a 28.4% increase in his salary.

&amp;#x200B;

# Our demands are clear:

1. Financial reimbursement for lack of services provided by UCSB that our tuition directly contributes towards (rec center, maintenance for buildings that are going unused, CAPs, etc.)
2. Financial compensation for the impediments our education is receiving and has already received.
3. The immediate halt on any plans to proceed with the building of Munger Hall. The conditions of Munger Hall are not suitable for living, and it is inhumane to require college students to live under these conditions. We need a verbal guarantee that Munger Hall will not become a reality.
4. The opening and revival of services we have already paid money for, including the recreation center and more. Otherwise, we are to receive some sort of further reimbursement.

&amp;#x200B;

Had we known what was in store for this winter quarter, we would have been allowed the choice to participate in this debauchery or not. But the decision was made conveniently after our dues were already taken, and without the consent of UCSB staff or students.

I have a dream that one day we will return to classes in person, and see our brothers, sisters, and non binaries face-to-face. Now I call upon you fellow Gauchos to stand with me. The day of **January 28th** will be a momentous occasion. At **2:00 PM**, we will gather together at **Storke Tower** where we will break bread and state our grievances, publicly and proudly, followed by a march to the UCEN.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Gauchos are created equal. That our time, our money, and our education are not something to be toiled with. I know many of you fellow Gauchos agree with me and I’ve listened to your voices. It seems that our grievances to the administration have been nothing more than whispers, but now, let’s make sure we make so much noise that they have no choice but to listen.",UCSantaBarbara,Time for a Revolution,https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/saftyo/time_for_a_revolution/,,

And I know there will be accommodations as mentioned in the email for those who don’t, however who knows how good the accommodations will be… I mean isn’t munger hall an accommodation/solution to the housing crisis..? And many professors probably don’t want to deal with online and in person. Anyways I feel like for those students that do return to campus obviously have a high risk of being exposed to covid as there are record cases each day and this would probably just increases the universities cases, pushing the need for online even more…",t3_rze2sc

But I think we all have to acknowledge that his visionary choice this afternoon to say ... absolutely nothing...he has brought us all together in this moment of crisis.

To a community sometimes bitterly divided over whether, in this moment, we should be teaching face to face, or remote--whether the  Omicron variant is a serious threat, or being overblown--our Chancellor has brought us all together, in complete harmony, singing with one voice.

We all now stand in complete unity as we say together: 

What. The. 💥 ❓

There an announcement from every *single* other UC campus: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, Santa Cruz, UCLA... all clarified their plans sometime over the last couple of days.

He's trained us all so well to expect the Friday 4:59PM email. And then ...

Nothing.

It took me several hours of being irritated, and seeing everyone else's irritation before I realized the genius of this move.

It's brilliant.

We aren't arguing with each other anymore. We are all just mad at Chancellor Yang.

He's given us the gift of a weekend of harmony and acord with one another.

Well played, Chancellor.  We are all now unified in a way we never could have imagined.  Bold leadership indeed.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 2 a.m., and a fire has broken out at Munger Hall at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The building’s 4,500 undergraduate residents stream down its 11 stories through more than a dozen fire exits and crowd shoulder-to-shoulder on the building’s small lot, where they’re hemmed in by streets, a police station, and a fire station that’s attempting to maneuver a half-dozen fire trucks and their hoses into position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob Hazard, the fire marshal of Santa Barbara County, described that scenario on Tuesday in a phone call with &lt;i&gt;The Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; in which he outlined his misgivings about the proposed 1.68-million-square-foot dormitory. Finding places for evacuated students to go, where they won’t be in the way of public-safety crews, is just one of the challenges posed by the project, which, if built, would be one of the densest residential-housing units on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;",t1_hrgj27n

The biggest flaw I’ve noticed, which other schools probably don’t have, is admin. As far as I can tell, they suck at their jobs. Theres not enough access cards, not enough housing, not enough spots in some classes, stupid covid restrictions (daily quiz, no ice cream machines), munger hall, and other annoying stupid ass decisions that baffle, frustrate, and stress out the student body. A lot of that won’t have a huge direct impact on you but, for me at least, it adds a lingering sense of chaos and stress which is never pleasant.",t1_hnyo11z

Using a model derive a function b(t) that describes daddy yang's schlong reaching full mast whenever munger hall gets mentioned. 

Other professors will be like.

 starting with a rigid rod and a blood flow function f(t) give an expression for daddy yang's schlong elongating when hearing about munger hall.

a) if daddy yang's heart beats at x BPM with a sawtooth wave function f(t) for flow derive the schlong blood flow function if his schlong is y inches long. 

B) the rate of daddy yang's schlong is proportional to the blood flow. 

All the way to 

F) now combine parts b and e to derive the true daddy yang schlong elongation rate. 



It's a more guided approach to a longer question that doesn't force people to get bogged down in the specifics. It's easier.

In a way, it was the most unrestrained place in China/Hong Kong, despite bad living conditions and being ruled by organized crime.

From that perspective, Munger Hall is the opposite.  It's intentionally built like a prison.  Every inch of it reinforces authority.  It's oppressive, joyless, mechanical, without soul, and designed expressly to crush the spirits of everyone living there (as opposed to Kowloon, which was constantly in danger of collapsing and literally crushing everyone in it).

The school has $10 and wants to buy a new building for $8 and wants to fix the Wi-Fi for $4. They need $2 which they will try to raise funding for through one of two ways:

Option 1: ask donors for $2 to fix Wi-Fi.

Option 2: ask donors for $2 for a building which they can put their name on.

Which do you think is more attractive to a donor? If you were the school which would you pick to make it more likely you get the $2 you need? Either way they now have $12 and can buy both. 

If option 1 they can use the $2 from the donor and $2 of their own to fix Wi-Fi and still have $8 leftover to build the building. If option 2 they can use the $2 from the donor and $6 of their own to build the building and still have $4 left over for wifi.

Either way their complying with their restrictions are they not? I don’t understand how people can complain about FREE MONEY. Would you rather have $10 or $12? The building needs to get built and wifi needs to get fixed.

Not a single person lived on the main floor, which was full of spectacular natural light, but you woke up to natural light as well, in every sleeping room, even the basement.

It was much more cost effective than this proposed building and met all the same requirements, though we did not all have our own rooms.

It was funded by a man far less wealthy than Charlie Munger, who can proudly say he built a house that is beautiful and will never be torn down, it will live on as a landmark as long as the school does.

In fact, the man to whom I owe my college education endowed more than a dozen scholarship houses at various Universities, and was never a billionaire. I doubt he ever had a million in liquid worth at any time, but he put more than 10,000 students through school.

""Munger Hall"" should be a legacy if he is gonna bother to build it. I think the vision is the problem, not the budget.

There may be kids who benefit from having their own rooms, but the building should be a magnet, it shouldn't be a place that kids hope to avoid living in. It should be a place they compete for a space in.

One thing I recall from my undergrad days (back in the 1980s) was that ""false fire alarms"" were a serious problem.   

That is, someone, typically some goofball that was way too inebriated, pulled a fire alarm as a ""prank"".

Let's acknowledge that such a ""prank"" is a serious crime, and should be treated as such, and was treated as such.  Even so, it was incredibly common, difficult to prevent or effectively punish (even with a single sanction, zero-tolerance, automatic permanent expulsion plus prosecution deterrent in place.).  Where I went to school, a fire alarm (regardless of cause) meant evacuating the building and standing in 20 degrees Farenheit weather for up to 45 minutes while the incident was investigated.   A rash of these could result in serious sleep deprivation for everyone living in the affected dorm.   It could also lead towards a culture of non-compliance with evacuation orders, which is a serious danger.

My question: how common are ""prank"" pulled fire alarms on college campuses today?  Has the student culture changed so much in the last 40 years that this is no longer a concern?   

If it has, then great.  No problem.  (I mean there might just possibly be other problems with Munger Hall but those are for another thread.)

But if it is still a problem (and as I type this, I'm hearing a building evacuation alarm going off somewhere on on the UCSB campus), then what would it mean to have to evacuate up to 4536 students (plus whatever support staff might be on duty) each time such an alarm is pulled?

When individual dorms are of a more reasonable size, any given prank (or real) fire alarm affects a relatively small number of people.  In this case, we are talking about 20% of the entire campus student population each time such an alarm is pulled.

This is an argument for, let's say, five physically separated buildings with 800-1000 students each instead of one giant one.

And given the extra outside surface area, probably there would be a lot more windows as well.   Whether those are attached to the dorm rooms, or just attached to common area windows in a ratio of more like 1 to 8 (as they are at U Michigan's Munger Hall) instead of 1 to 64 (as proposed for UCSB's), well that's another topic.

The part about Mr. Munger's approach that is most frustrating is his petulant ""my way or the highway"" refusal to even engage.  I wonder if he thinks of himself as some kind of Howard Roark from Ayn Rand's \[The Fountainhead\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Fountainhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead)).   I haven't seen anyone else make the parallel, but once I saw it, I couldn't unsee it.    The difference is that Howard Roark at least was a trained architect as opposed to just being a wealthy dilettante.",UCSantaBarbara,False fire alarms: how common are they at UCSB?

The bedrooms themselves have one single exit point. That's blocked off? Guess you'll die.

But not even that, the houses themselves that hold 80 people have a whole *two* exit points where people will have to funnel themselves out of before getting to a staircase. Those are blocked off? That's a few dozen people trapped. And if they aren't blocked off? There's still *640 people* on each floor, all trying to stuff themselves down 10 staircases.

That is a good point you make about the elevators.

Perhaps the idea is to address the problem of lack of exercise, lol, but there are eleven total floors by my count, and that is a lot to ask of a student to trek multiple times a day.

That is also a very interesting point about the increased noise, but I doubt that would actually be a problem. I'm sure that is something addressed in the design and balancing of any HVAC system. Lots of buildings would have the same issue to a degree, otherwise.",t1_hj92g36

The real reason is that Munger Hall is an example of UCSB being run like a business at the expense of the quality of the student experience. The lack of windows is a talking point because it contrasts what students love about UCSB — great social life, central coast beaches — versus what the university is providing: cramped singles with a prison-like layout and no natural light.

I'm actually not sure Munger Hall gives opportunity for more underprivileged people to attend UCSB, it just gives the opportunity for more people to attend UCSB, full stop. Remember, the housing crisis was *created* by the university administration. The university gets more money from having more students, especially out-of-state and international students that pay higher tuition. Munger Hall is a way for the university to get 4,500 more tuitions in their pocket without having to pay full price for the building.

The nail in the coffin, for me at least, is the way negotiations went down. Munger wants final say on the design for donating $200MM for a $1.5 billion project. That's still $1.3 billion out of pocket for the residence hall, you're telling me there's no better way that money could be spent on a design more in line with what the students, who will actually have to live there, want? I hate that my school is being bought out by the highest bidder. I wish the administration was strong enough to say ""we are a public university with an obligation to our students, we cannot accept a donation with large strings attached"".

By building Munger Hall, the university is saying ""we don't care about finding the best solution; we dug ourselves into a hole and want the cheapest and quickest way out"". And that's why people are mad.",t1_hjj85r6

Do you read anything outside of social.  There is news every day covering the odd shit rich people ""get to say"" about the use of their donations (i.e. Munger Hall).  Buildings, walkways, wings...  Everyone gets a say.  Even if you're buying a brick on a pathway, you get to weigh in on the font and color.

I have  no stake in this project or anything related to UCSB, but based on press reports and this sub I did think it was crazy that 94% of rooms didn't have windows, so I decided to look at the details.

I am sure the down votes will come, but after seeing the above presentation I do think there are some merits over just reacting to the headline of ""college students with no windows"".   Please at least click through the pictures in the above presentation and ask yourself if you'd rather live there or where you lived in college.  

Some things I thought were positive:

1. Every student with a private place to sleep and study.  This would have been valuable to me in college especially my junior and senior year when I really needed to focus on finishing up my degree and being productive.  Truthfully, I think I would have traded off private room over window if you gave me the choice.
2. Having an 8 person space with kitchen, common area and 8 individual rooms would actually be pretty cool way to live with 8 friends in college.
3. Having markets, bakeries, theatres, gyms, study spaces, counseling/psych and classrooms integrated into the building seems great.
4. The dorm has 4536 beds for people to sleep in!  Think about what a unique addition that is to our community.

I guess I see why some people love IV, but I could see a LOT of students also choosing to live someplace like this over IV.

I think we have developed a culture of shouting ""NO"" to new ideas in California.  Between 1954 and 1965 we created 4 new UC schools.  In the 56 years since 1965 we have only opened Merced which only has about 7000 students. Also, according to 1972 census only 43% of public high school kids went to college versus 63% now.  My rough estimate is that we have 3x the number of kids who want to attend college in 1965 versus today. If we truly believe in education, we need to find ways to provide high quality UC education to more CA students.  

I am not saying I love the idea of this monstrous dorm, but I am kind of open to considering it versus quickly rejecting based on the lack of windows.",SantaBarbara,Munger Hall Plans,https://old.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/qm20qx/munger_hall_plans/,,

The architect, Dennis J. McFadden, described the project’s design as “unsupportable from my perspective as an architect, a parent, and a human being.” The 11-story building is based on a design created by Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of Warren Buffett and a vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger donated $200 million toward the project on the condition that it be built according to his plans. He has no formal training as an architect, but has donated hundreds of millions of dollars, with the same caveat, for buildings at major universities and other institutions, according to The Wall Street Journal.
  

  
Contacted on Friday, Munger said it was the first he’d heard of the architect’s objection. Any big project invites controversy, he said, but he has no intention of tweaking his design to satisfy critics. “There isn’t the slightest chance I’m going to change,” he said.

If the university were to require any changes, “They’re not going to have my donation,” Munger said. “Why would I let one crazy man change the design?”
  

  
The planned dorm, which was presented to the campus’s Design Review Committee as 100-percent complete, would house about 4,500 students in single rooms, 94 percent of which would lack windows, according to McFadden, a highly-respected Southern California architect. Munger’s idea was that small, windowless bedrooms would encourage students to come out and congregate in common spaces.
  

  
“In the nearly 15 years I served as a consulting architect to the DRC, no project was brought before the committee that is larger, more transformational, and potentially more destructive to the campus as a place than Munger Hall,” McFadden wrote in his October 24 resignation letter to Julie Hendricks, UCSB’s campus architect.
  

  
In an email to The Chronicle on Friday , a campus spokeswoman, Andrea Estrada, said the university was grateful for McFadden’s contributions and insights while serving as an advisory consultant and that it recognized the value of considering multiple design perspectives. However, she added, the university is “delighted to be moving forward with this transformational project.”

She said the plan was a collaboration among the university, Munger, and Navy Banvard, whom she described as a distinguished architect with Van Tilburg, Banvard, and Soderbergh. McFadden said his understanding was that the plan was based entirely on input from Munger, who, in his conversation with The Chronicle, also took credit for the design. McFadden declined further comment, saying he hadn’t planned to go public with his objections, but that he was glad the controversy was being aired after his resignation letter was shared on the social-media site Reddit.
  

  
Estrada said all housing projects are guided by a campus plan that seeks to provide affordable, energy-efficient housing that reduces the number of students living in a neighboring community that also suffers from housing shortages. The Santa Barbara campus is under intense pressure to build thousands more dorm rooms to accommodate its growing student body.
  

  
Munger defended his plans in his conversation with The Chronicle. “The whole idea is to get people closer together so they educate each other. There will be 4,500 students in one building, and almost everything they need will be there,” he said.
  

  
The UCSB project, Munger said, is a modified version of a graduate-housing project he designed at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The Munger Graduate Residence, which opened in 2015 and also saw pushback to the design, “is a raging hit there,” he said. “You never saw such a happy group of students. It’s working like gangbusters.”
  

  
Officials at the University of Michigan did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.
  

  
Among the advantages, Munger said, are single rooms for all students. If they want sunlight and views of the surroundings, they can go into a common room, the way passengers on Disney cruise ships leave their rooms to step out into common areas with windows. The individual dorm rooms, he said, will have “a better version” of the artificial windows on Disney cruise ships, which he said are a hit with passengers.
  

  
In a July news release, the university described the massive project, which the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper dubbed “Dormzilla,” as “absolutely stunning.”

“Munger Hall — a joint venture between the university and philanthropist Charles Munger — will fulfill the university’s commitment to provide not only more student housing, but housing that is both better and more affordable for students,” the release said. “It will do so with flourish and elegance.”
  

  
The university’s chancellor, Henry T. Yang, praised Munger’s “inspired and revolutionary design.” It will include study areas, meeting rooms, lecture halls, and “a wealth of social spaces that bring students together in community with one another,” he said.
  

  
McFadden sees otherwise. One of his primary objections is the lack of windows in most bedrooms, as well as the fact that it does nothing to take advantage of the campus’s stunning setting overlooking the Pacific Ocean. “An ample body of documented evidence shows that interior environments with access to natural light, air, and views to nature improve both the physical and mental well-being of occupants,” his resignation letter states. “The Munger Hall design ignores this evidence and seems to take the position that it doesn’t matter.”
  

  
The building’s eight-person living units are “sealed environments with no exterior windows in the shared space or in 94 percent of the bedrooms,” McFadden wrote.
  

  
“The design team offered no research or data to justify the radical departure from student-housing standards, historical trends, evidence-based design principles, and basic sustainability principles. Rather, as the ‘vision’ of a single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves.”
  

  
Among those who objected to the project was Marc Vukcevich, a former member of the design-review committee who graduated from UCSB in June.
  

  
“My freshman-year roommate committed suicide, and the idea that students could self-isolate in a windowless room alarms me,” he said in an interview.

The university’s Graduate Student Association said, in an email to the university, that by going ahead with the dorm, the university is ignoring the input of students, faculty members, and the consultant hired to review the project. “There is mounting evidence that Munger Hall, as currently designed, will have a detrimental impact on students’ mental health and bodily safety,” it says.
  

  
McFadden also found the sheer size of the project troubling. Munger Hall would have just two entrances and “would qualify as the eighth-densest neighborhood on the planet,” he wrote. “It would be able to house Princeton University’s entire undergraduate population,” he added. “The project is essentially the student-life portion of a mid-sized university campus in a box.”",t3_qlyf9n

Part of an alternative might have been to build higher density in the preceding years... the most recent undergrad dorm built by the University is Manzanita Village. Compare that with the Munger megadorm. The two projects are lightyears apart in density and design philosophy. 

UCSB is somewhat painted into a corner, but building a bad project to get out of it is not the answer. Maybe they need to go back to the state and lower the enrollment cap. Or ask the state for funds to build housing in a way that is in character with the campus and will support the students in their education.

OR, if they do want to go through with this unproven concept... they need to actually study if it works, i.e. if it leads to poor outcomes for a lot of the students. So at the very minimum if this building is a $1.5B mistake, negatively impacting some fraction of 4500 students per year for decades, they should find out and not repeat it on other UC campuses if it was a mistake.  Of course that will never happen, big organizations never make mistakes (or at least never want to find out that they did).

That's one big issue with UM's Munger Hall: it doesn't seem as if they studied if it led to good outcomes. Because UM's Munger Hall exists, whether or not it worked well, it's being used as a justification for UCSB's Munger dorm.",t1_hj14wmv

Warren Buffett's billionaire partner bankrolls windowless dorm. An architect quit

Billionaire Charlie Munger is bankrolling the design of a massive dormitory at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The $1.5 billion project comes with a major catch — 94% of the dorm's single occupancy rooms have no windows.

UCSB's campus is located on cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean and has its own beach. Its beachfront location is an integral part of campus culture and identity — and Munger Hall doesn't reflect this, McFadden claimed.

""Even the rooftop courtyard... looks inward and may as well be on the ground in the desert as on the eleventh floor on the coast of California"" McFadden wrote.

In addition to being Warren Buffett's right-hand man, Munger is an amateur architect. He has no formal education in the field.

Munger, the 97-year-old vice chairman of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, donated $200 million to UCSB to fund the dorms, with the caveat that his designs are followed. He wanted the dorm rooms to be tiny and windowless to encourage residents to spend more time outside in the common areas, meeting other students.

That didn't sit right with McFadden.

""As the 'vision' of the single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the University serves"" McFadden wrote.

The plan for Munger Hall includes an 11-story building that would provide more than 4500 beds for undergraduates. Each residential floor would have eight Houses, each holding 63 students. There are eight suites in each House, and every suite has eight single-occupancy beds — window not included. Each suite also has two bathrooms and a common space.

However, the rooms do have artificial windows, which Munger said resemble the Disney cruise ship's artificial portholes where ""starfish come in and wink at (...)

Munger, vice chairman at Berkshire Hathaway, has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to universities and high schools to build school facilities he designed himself. But the amateur architect’s latest idea for a mostly windowless mega-dorm to be built on the University of California at Santa Barbara campus faced objection this week when a university architectural consultant quit, calling the plan “unsupportable from my perspective as an architect, a parent, and a human being.”

Dennis McFadden, a Los Angeles architect and member of the university’s design review committee of 15 years, wrote in his resignation letter that he was “disturbed” by the 11-story, 1.68 million-square-foot building with just two entrances. The massive dorm would house 4,500 students, 94 percent of whom would not have windows in their compact single-occupancy bedrooms. McFadden called the dorm the “wrong answer” to the need for more housing ― raising the question of how much authority wealthy donors have when it comes to planning the buildings their names are etched on.

“As the ‘vision’ of a single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves,” McFadden wrote in the letter, first reported by student-run newspaper the Daily Nexus and community outlet the Santa Barbara Independent.

Munger, who has no formal architecture training, says he’s unfazed by McFadden’s objections, telling The Washington Post that “this is not some crazy idea.” He said his plan has been in the works for years and compared virtual windows that would simulate sunlight in the dorm rooms to those in Disney cruise staterooms.

The $1.5 billion project, of which Munger is contributing $200 million, will proceed despite McFadden’s letter, a university spokeswoman said.

“We are delighted to be moving forward with this transformational project that directly addresses the campus’s great need for more student housing,” Andrea Estrada wrote in a statement to The Post.

“We are grateful for Mr. McFadden’s contributions and insights during his tenure as an advisory consultant,” Estrada added. “We believe that it is a valuable part of our process to consider multiple design perspectives, which is why we ask several external consultants to assist with our project reviews.”

Munger, the 97-year-old business partner of Warren Buffett, has previously called conventional architecture “massively stupid,” earning him little favor among professionals.

“Architects don’t love me,” he told the Wall Street Journal in 2019. “Either I change architects, or he does it my way.”

Munger said he approaches designing buildings as he would investing: with extreme rationalism.

After years of hearing family members complain about sharing bedrooms in communal college dorms, Munger realized it was possible to give people their own sleeping space by sacrificing the rooms’ natural light.

“I was bound by the conventions when I realized how stupid it was,” he said. “Naturally, I was sort of ashamed taking so long to reach such an obvious conclusion.”

On Friday, following backlash over the design, Munger told The Post that his buildings have been successful on campuses including Stanford and the University of Michigan.

“On any big project, you can’t get any two architects to agree on anything,” he said. “There’s always going to be some criticism.”

The University of Michigan facility was also designed to increase density by largely eschewing windows. In 2013, he donated $110 million to build a dorm for graduate students, a building originally set for 300 residents that he conceived as a space for 600.

“I was just there last month and the students are absolutely in orbit,” he said. “They love the place, and the university loves having it.”

Munger rejected McFadden’s claim that the plan had little input, saying he has spent years on the project with architectural firms.

“I’m not anti-architecture,” he said. “I just love it in a different way.”

His idea has earned the praise of school officials.

UC-Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry T. Yang called Munger’s design “inspired and revolutionary.”

But McFadden opposed the suggestion, resigning following the presentation of the plan at an Oct. 5 design review committee meeting.

PowerPoint slides of the plan, called “Charlie’s Vision,” tout study spaces, dining options, a theater and other amenities.

During the meeting, Navy Banvard, the architect for Munger Hall, told the committee members that the bedrooms will have “virtual windows that simulate daylight,” the Daily Nexus reported.

McFadden wrote that “an ample body of documented evidence shows that interior environments with access to natural light, air and views to nature improve both the physical and mental wellbeing of occupants.”

“The Munger Hall design ignores this evidence and seems to take the position that it doesn’t matter,” he added.

Some builders have cut out windows with the goal of enhancing workplace productivity or heightening security, but architects who favor the light they provide argue windows are necessary for sustainability and comfort.

McFadden also raised concerns that the building would look “out of place” in its surroundings on the waterfront campus and reach an unprecedented density. The dorm would qualify as the eighth densest neighborhood on the planet, falling just short of Dhaka, Bangladesh, according to McFadden.

“The project is essentially the student life portion of a mid-sized university campus in a box,” he wrote.

McFadden told The Post that others on the committee raised the same concerns during the meeting. He said he wasn’t sure how his resignation letter appeared on the Internet and declined to answer other questions about the review process for the dorm’s plan. In his letter, he wrote that it was apparent the expert committee was viewed as a “mere formality” and that approval or input was not required for the design “described as 100% complete.”

“Yet in the 15 years I served as a consulting architect to the DRC, no project was brought before the committee that is larger, more transformational and potentially more destructive to the campus as a place than Munger Hall,” he wrote. “This is the very project the committee exists to consider.”

Carla Yanni, an architectural history professor at Rutgers University, emphasized the importance of consulting students, architects and student services staff to design a dorm that considers the residents’ needs and surroundings. She described how her university has built full-scale models of housing for students to test before construction begins.

Dorms should be planned in a way that encourages students to mingle and collaborate, said Yanni, the author of “Living on Campus: An Architectural History of the American Dormitory.”

But, she said, this manifestation of that idea doesn’t acknowledge the spate of social science research explaining the consequences of such a windowless design.

“The arrogance of the proposal is breathtaking,” Yanni said.",t3_qj6y7u

&gt; In October 2014, Munger announced that he would donate $65 million to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This is the largest gift in the history of the school. The donation went towards the construction of a residence building designed by Munger for visitors of the Kavli Institute in an effort to bring together physicists to exchange ideas as Munger stated,""to talk to one another, create new stuff, cross-fertilize ideas"".
&gt;
&gt;In March 2016, Munger announced a further $200 million gift to UC Santa Barbara, conditioned on the university’s commitment to spend it on an undergraduate dormitory of Munger’s own unconventional design, featuring windowless bedrooms, tripling the record gift he gave for the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. In October, 2021, Munger's insistence that the university follow his design compelled professional architect, Dennis McFadden, who had served the university for two decades, to resign from the university's Design Review Committee. McFadden stated that the windowless, 1.68-million-square-foot dormitory would be “'unsupportable from my perspective as an architect, a parent, and a human being.... An ample body of documented evidence shows that interior environments with access to natural light, air, and views to nature improve both the physical and mental wellbeing of occupants.... The Munger Hall design ignores this evidence and seems to take the position that it doesn’t matter.... [T]he building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves.""

There are only two points of entry and exit.

""The project is essentially the student life portion of a mid-sized university campus in a box,"" McFadden wrote. ""Munger Hall is an experiment in size and density with no precedent in student housing at that scale.""

The plan was designed by architect Navy Banvard, a principal at Van Tilburg, Banvard, &amp; Soderbergh. Banvard said Munger Hall is a collaborative process between UCSB, Munger and the design team.

UCSB, like other universities, is facing a housing crisis. The Daily Nexus reported in August that UCSB ran out of spaces in university housing and had a waitlist of over 1,000 students who were searching for a place to live.

""One of the reasons, and there are many, for the project is to address the University's substantive housing needs,"" Banvard said. ""Good and affordable housing for students in a very competitive housing market.""

The lack of planning done by UCSB (especially relative to UCSD, SDSU, UCLA and UCM) to accommodate more students even when they have the status to override local zoning laws is frustrating. They could have done their due diligence and construct housing the cheap/good yet slow way, but now they have no other choice but to go with the current option.

At least it makes me appreciate what UCSD is doing, where they give the middle finger to the San Diego Coastal Height limit and build an [entire 10 storey tall college](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTLKRfPqzkQ&amp;list=PLqPXJrXI3wRk5rpkwPaikJt6xp9Qb08HE&amp;index=5) with 2000 beds and academic facilities in the same footprint as UCSB's Munger Hall.

Let’s not only blame UCSB. SBCC also needs build housing on its campus. The community colleges have been funded even less than the UC and rely mainly on local bonds to build. I’ve been pushing sbcc to build student housing since I got elected to the board in 2014. Finally we have some movement thanks to the State of California finally funding a small amount of community college student housing feasibility studies. I will keep doing my part as a member of the 2nd biggest educational institution in SB county to ensure student housing is built, but the real problem here the housing needed for UCSB students and the State of California needs to step up, especially given the unique history here from the 1940s-1960s to limit the development of student housing when state money was flowing towards that need. 

PSS 

I am so disappointed about how simplistic and one-sidedly the local news has reported on this, this is a complex story and situation that cannot be reduced to 1 of these issues.

*Debt financing is a mechanism UC has to take on debt to fund the construction of a project. Each UC has a debt ceiling that is pretty low. Student housing projects usually need 100% debt financing so they demand more of the limited pie of debt available. The debt for student housing projects is paid for in student housing price increasing beyond inflation. Once upon a time I was on the UCSB chancellor’s Student housing committee and a decision before us was the way to implement the rent increase over the next years in order to absorb new debt taken on to build San Joaquin. We also looked at the rent increases used to fund San Clemente. Funding new housing through rent increases is not sustainable. It’s been UCSB’s only way to do it without state or private funding. 

Clarification: I am posting this 100% on my own behalf not representing SBCC or IVCSD or SBCAN or any other group I'm in that may have an opinion on this issue. Also I probably should’ve done the history of public policy major instead of Political science at UCSB, train has passed on that for sure.

The State has never restored the huge cuts from the 2000s and Great Recession. UC didn’t raise tuition for 7ish years until recently passing a “tuition only goes up for the new class” policy that is terrible, state funds were promised to go up if tuition stayed the same but that mostly did not happen. This lack of state funding for the basic operations of UC, especially in the late 2000s/early 2010s led to a mentality at UC (from top to bottom) that the state money was drying up and will be gone soon, that UC will need to focus on and rely on philanthropy more like a private university to survive. This is a key part of the history. This shift in mentality in how to run the UC, driven by administrators at all levels, but at the end of the day the responsibility of the policies set by the State of California. Even at the student government we resorted to literally taxing ourselves with “student initiated fees” to provided needed services like a food bank since going after public or tuition funds was impossible to fund necessities like that. 

Here’s just another fact: the State of California has not put real funding into the construction of student housing for 40+ years (in 1957 they proudly did so), and what they have done is a tiny drop in the bucket. Most of the older dorms at UC were built with loans authorized by Title IV of the Housing Act of 1950 and Title VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Almost all of it since 1980 has been privately financed or “debt financed*” by the UC. The State finally funded a tiny $500 million this September to split between UC, CSU, and all 112 community colleges. UC’s are major economic engines for their communities, who would not be as well off at all without their UC, but they are also a major disruption on the housing market —— *especially* when they are growing enrollment at rapid paces demanded by *Political Opportunism* and not good governance. It is hard to absorb so many people so fast because no community or campus builds housing that fast, and it leads to the terrible housing crisis for UCSB students in 2020 and 2014 (as far as I saw myself, I know there were many more at different times in different UCs). So that State has created these huge institutions, made them bigger at a fast pace, and did not account for that population change in the community they are in (or the people harmed by gentrification). The UC has never been equipped to build housing, it is a hard and expensive business. They do not have the kind of money needed lying around to make big housing investments or a way to raise that revenue besides debt financing. It really is up to the State to finance (or otherwise the private market, which we are seeing is not ideal).

Related Fact: UCSB however is different than the rest of the UC in that it has a local cap on its enrollment as part of agreements with local groups and governments. UCSB asserts they have not exceeded the 25,000 3 quarter average (though it seems they’ve met it ahead of schedule, probably because of the enrollment growth pushed by the State of California). 

Second related fact: Housing costs are more than tuition costs at UC even with its high tuition! There is a huge housing shortage in Isla Vista / UCSB / South County Santa Barbara. It’s such a problem for people, it’s even a problem for me personally (my buildings rent went up 10%!). Students are living in hotels this quarter. Year after year students live in cars. The vacancy rate is less than 1% and people are packed in way beyond the lease capacity. IV has built 4 buildings really in 15 years itself (IV planning and zoning are important too but I won’t get into here it’s irrelevant to the final point). When I lived at 6575 DP it was 4 of us to a room and rent was still over $700! Security deposits on DP now are *Thirty Thousand Dollars.* So many friends dropped out due to housing, a lot of best friends had housing issues interrupting school. A disproportionate amount of people whose education is negatively impacted by housing shortages are students of color, first generation students, and/or low-income students. Did you know that almost every room at UCSB is currently a triple? Yes even those small San Nic rooms.

Here is another fact: UCSB most specifically has a bad a history with student housing. Isla Vista’s creation was a way to make Big Money on super dense private student housing in the 1950s-60s was made possible by clever manipulations and abuse of powers to restrict UCSB from building student housing beyond what was needed for the freshman class and only on the main campus, so that Isla Vista could be divided up and sold as private student housing for a profit — the County even gave them special dense zoning that makes the “IV Box” the densest place west of the Mississippi just so they can make extra money. UCSB eventually got to building more housing beyond the main campus and a lot of it was after demands to do so, and pretty much all of debt financed, something that has strict limitations outlined below (I tried to get around it and learned so much on it when trying to do the renovation of the UCen). This is one option for reform, but not perfect since it does result in higher rents for all to pay off the debt (plus interest!!!).  At the end of the day, UCSB needs to build through its student housing deficit that has existed since its creation. It needs to build that housing on its existing campus owned land. There are limited options to do this. 

An extremely important fact: the lack of bedroom windows in the Munger Hall proposal is a bad idea at a university that already has rampant mental health issues. Granted there is a lot of sun light in common areas that are right next to bedrooms and it should flow into the rooms with open doors, people should still have a window. A “munger hall” already exists at Ann Arbor and I’ll post links to a tour of the apartment and bedroom a medical student put on YouTube. The layout has a lot of good ideas, but the lack of windows has rightfully led so many people to believe it’ll have negative mental health impacts - the guy who made the videos looks visibly shaken while explaining the negatives of not having them, but also seems to generally like the rest of it. There are many studies that show windows are a must. I think the simulated windows that are in the UCSB proposal and absent from Michigan could help, but the studies show real windows are important. Let’s just remember this no window thing, it’s specifically the idea of Charles Munger, a billionaire putting up $200 million to make this project happen (and possibly the full cost). There are other design issues like with all building projects, but I do think some are exaggerated like the ""2 entrance"" issue (its not a count of emergency exits), I personally believe UCSB will follow all fire codes and building regulations in whatever they make.

Therefore, because the state of California has underfunded both UC operations and facilities like student housing for the last 40-50 years, the UC went down a path of focusing on philanthropy to meet its needs (and that comes with strings), which at UCSB combined with our uniquely terrible housing crunch without much land to expand, and the limitations of debt financing, and the commitments UCSB has to build a bed for each new student since 2010, led to a billionaire 97-year-old pledging $200 million and getting to drive the details of the much needed 4,000 units of housing because there is literally no one else standing up to fund it. Is it daft of UCSB to bet everything on this project getting built to meet their housing production needs/requirements? Yes. But did they have another funding source to build the housing that’s needed? No. And that is the State of California’s fault. Public institutions simply are not built to have the capital to undertake development at that scale. The State is.


Here’s a fun tid bit, in early 2014 I was in San Francisco for a UC regents meeting and the UCSB San Joaquin project came up for approval (I had been on the project committee as a freshman). The project was relatively cheap $150 million for 1,000 beds that will rent at rates below Isla Vista rents. Governor Jerry Brown, a member of the board of regents at the time and stopping in, actually spoke up and said that the project was amazing and we needed more them across the state. But that was it, no progress took place beyond that. 

So I’ve got a challenge to the State of California - put up the remaining $1.3 billion, give the People of California control of this needed housing project, and allow it to be built in a way that best serves students, the surrounding community, and still meets the very real housing needs we have. Did I mention how much we need housing built at UCSB? And yes its a lot to say they should put up all this money just for this one project, at the very least the State needs to set up a significant and reliable funding source for student housing. This is one of those problems that is easily quantifiable and easy to measure progress on solving - let’s just do it and put it behind us. It is a real tangible change the State can have on benefiting the local rental markets in every community with a college (which is so many!). The only people who will hurt are the landlords who’ve made untold amounts of money off of private student housing for decades.

427,JonathanAbboud,2021-10-30 04:40:52+00:00,t3_qiu48u,,"In this post I will explain how and why the State of California Legislature’s 50 year backwards policy approach to public higher education started by Ronald Reagan resulted in a “Windowless Dorm at UCSB” becoming a viral news story today. Also will hopefully give you a lot more details and information than the article below.

The most important fact here: The State of California Legislature, Governor and Government as a whole through history is completely responsible for anything and everything that happens with the University of California. While it has some constitutional independence (over important things like academic freedom), the State of California controls the entire Board of Regents since the Governors appoints them and the State Senate approves them. Rest of the regents are mainly State Officials themselves. Total control. About 50% of the UC Core Funds (the money the funds things like professors and services) come from the State of California (ie taxpayers), the other 40% is from the Students/Parents (who have zero control or say), and the UC itself generates like 10% which includes the out-of-state tuition (these are rough numbers). Student housing gets zero state money, it’s not part of Core Funds at all and must self-sustain. So the fact is, all the UC’s are very direct institutions of the “State of California,” our primary culprit here.

Another fact: The University of California latest enrollment growth is 100% driven by State Legislators (ie elected politicians who have parents of rejected students as voters). Year after they they push “unfunded growth” onto the UC. Unfunded growth means they demand more students are accepted and enrolled but do not provide the funds necessary to expand the school faculty + staff to educate them, you want to maintain quality too which is half the point of UC (other one is research). There is incredible demand for a UC education. Demand for a college education keeps growing and people have a warped view of “TOP SCHOOL” so their kid must only go to UCB, UCLA, or UCSB not UCM or UCR or community college or trade school (building more UCs is actually the right long term move but not one that meets the immediate political needs of state reps). So as this demand increases and specifically for certain schools, there are more rejections and more people who want a seat at (a specific) UC calling on theirs reps to open more seats. UC is already taking steps this year, under legislature directive, to open up more seats to California residents by reducing out of state and international students. You don’t want to reduce these to 0 or near 0, they add a lot to what makes UC an amazing experience (I love all my out of state and international friends).

A fact to not forget: The State of California year after year has funded the UC less by either cutting or not meeting inflation - this policy was started by no one other than Ronald Reagan and continued almost every year since 1969.

It is a real tangible change the State can have on benefiting the local rental markets in every community with a college (which is so many!). The only people who will hurt are the landlords who’ve made untold amounts of money off of private student housing for decades.

Call to Action: Call up your representative and tell them the State of California needs to take responsibility for the student housing issue and fund the construction of it.

PS.

Let’s not only blame UCSB. SBCC also needs build housing on its campus. The community colleges have been funded even less than the UC and rely mainly on local bonds to build. I’ve been pushing sbcc to build student housing since I got elected to the board in 2014. Finally we have some movement thanks to the State of California finally funding a small amount of community college student housing feasibility studies. I will keep doing my part as a member of the 2nd biggest educational institution in SB county to ensure student housing is built, but the real problem here the housing needed for UCSB students and the State of California needs to step up, especially given the unique history here from the 1940s-1960s to limit the development of student housing when state money was flowing towards that need. 

PSS 

I am so disappointed about how simplistic and one-sidedly the local news has reported on this, this is a complex story and situation that cannot be reduced to 1 of these issues.

*Debt financing is a mechanism UC has to take on debt to fund the construction of a project. Each UC has a debt ceiling that is pretty low. Student housing projects usually need 100% debt financing so they demand more of the limited pie of debt available. The debt for student housing projects is paid for in student housing price increasing beyond inflation. Once upon a time I was on the UCSB chancellor’s Student housing committee and a decision before us was the way to implement the rent increase over the next years in order to absorb new debt taken on to build San Joaquin. We also looked at the rent increases used to fund San Clemente. Funding new housing through rent increases is not sustainable. It’s been UCSB’s only way to do it without state or private funding. 

Clarification: I am posting this 100% on my own behalf not representing SBCC or IVCSD or SBCAN or any other group I'm in that may have an opinion on this issue. Also I probably should’ve done the history of public policy major instead of Political science at UCSB, train has passed on that for sure.

Why would UCSB even CONSIDER accepting this proposal? Well, besides the fact it's $200m, UCSB has also been dealing with a pretty severe [housing crisis](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/van-life-street-medicine-shirley-raines/ucsb-housing-students). UCSB ""guarantees"" housing for incoming students, but despite this, they were unable to provide apartments or dorms for all incoming students this year, and actually forced many new students to live in hotels this past quarter that the university rented (and yes, students were charged for them). This is on top of many students also being forced to live out of cars/vans.

The rental market in Isla Vista (the college community next to UCSB) is absolutely ridiculous. Despite having essentially no buildings taller than 4 stories (besides the famous ""[Fuck Towers](https://localwiki.org/islavista/Santa_Catalina_%28Francisco_Torres%29)""), the population density of Isla Vista is 12,376/mi^(2) (4779/km^(2)) ([for comparison](https://www.geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/California-Population-Density-Map-1.png)). And this is in Santa Barbara County, which has some of the highest housing prices in the nation. 

Munger Hall sounds a bit like a dystopian nightmare, but given the housing climate in the area (and the size of the donation), it's understandable why UCSB seems to be okay with moving forward with the idea.",t3_qikrtf

Munger donated $200 million to the building's construction on the condition they use his design.

So some wanna be architect is trying to ram through his amateurish attempt at a building by donating a shit ton of money for it, this will be an interesting test of ethics for the university. Will they actually realize the disaster in the making this is or just want the money so bad they'll just do whatever it takes to get that donation?

I think we all know the answer to that but this smacks to me of the disaster that the dorms at Waterloo University in Ontario were that were designed by a prison architect in a bid to reduce problem behavior by students. From what I saw when I visited it didn't stop any student hijinks it just made for a miserable place to live.

&gt; Munger believes his design would force students out of their rooms and into common areas for more interpersonal interactions. But McFadden said there is ""an ample body of documented evidence shows that interior environments with access to natural light, air, and views to nature improve both the physical and mental well-being of occupants.""

&gt; ""The Munger Hall design ignores this evidence and seems to take the position that it doesn't matter,"" he added.

&gt;So far, McFadden continued, **the university has not offered any research or data to justify the unprecedented departure from normal student housing standards, historical trends, and basic sustainability principles. “Rather,” he said, “as the ‘vision’ of a single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves.”**

&gt;McFadden explains he felt compelled to step down from from the Design Review Committee (DRC) after it became clear during an October 5 presentation that the dorm’s plans were already set in stone. “The design was described as 100% complete, approval was not requested, no vote was taken, and no further submittals are intended or required,” he said. “Yet in the nearly fifteen years I served as a consulting architect to the DRC, no project was brought before the committee that is larger, more transformational, and potentially more destructive to the campus as a place than Munger Hall.” This kind of outlandish proposal is why the committee exists, he said.

On top of being an architectural trainwreck, Munger Hall makes zero sense from an engineering perspective as well. Giant buildings are great for minimizing heating costs and protecting people from the elements, which makes them great for dealing with harsh East Coast and Midwestern winters. That logic does not apply here in sunny California. Notice that every dorm and apartment here has large panoramic windows that let in plenty of natural light, and more importantly cool air flow that negate the need for expensive air conditioning. Buildings are also narrow and sprawling so they'd contain less heat and ventilate better.

492,B1GNA5TY,2021-09-24 20:22:37+00:00,t3_pursr3,,"September 24, 2021  
We are writing today to update our campus community on all the steps we have taken to provide additional housing for our returning students who have reported difficulty in finding housing for the fall quarter, which has been covered extensively in local news media.  
 

Like that of other UC campuses and universities around the state, UC Santa Barbara’s student housing has been impacted by the pandemic. While we have constructed a number of new residence halls that have added more than 1,500 beds over the last several years, have a long-term agreement with the management of Tropicana Student Living to provide student housing in line with campus facilities, and have achieved a significant milestone toward building the 4,500 bed Munger Hall, demand for space in our university housing and in the community has outpaced capacity.  
 

The rental market in Santa Barbara and Goleta is historically challenging, but this year in particular, the community of Isla Vista, where many of our students live, also experienced a shortage of rental space. While many factors contribute to the situation, a recent news report citing a student legal advocate with deep experience in IV housing suggested three circumstances that exacerbated the problem during the pandemic.  


* Remote work arrangements are enabling many people to move from larger cities to more desirable locations, including the Santa Barbara area, and this has decreased the available housing.  

* Less dense housing situations in Isla Vista and neighboring communities have added to the constraints.  

* Although the University announced its intention to return to in-person learning for the fall quarter in February 2021, many students, understandably, still were uncertain about how fall quarter would be conducted and waited longer than they might have otherwise to find and secure housing.  


Contrary to reports in news outlets and on social media, campus enrollment has not exceeded the three-quarter average of 25,000 on-campus students outlined in the 2010 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), which was created to shape how the campus will develop to the year 2025. Enrollment this year is at the same level it was prior to the pandemic. The incremental enrollment growth prior to the pandemic was in response to mandates from the State Legislature and the Governor for increased UC enrollment, which at UC Santa Barbara was limited due to the negotiated LRDP.  
 

By maximizing our use of campus housing, the University was able to offer housing contracts to all first- and second-year students, new transfer students, and graduate students who applied before the July application deadline and who had not secured an off-campus option. In addition, contracts were offered to more than 1,000 students who applied for housing after the July deadline.  
 

As of September 20, 2021, the University has been able to offer housing to every undergraduate who applied for a housing contract. We are working to offer contracts to the 8 undergraduates who applied just this week. We have also offered housing contracts to all graduate students who applied for housing, although, like previous years, there are still a handful who are waiting for family housing units to become available.   
 

Altogether, the University is providing more on-campus housing than was available prior to the pandemic.  
 

To address the number of students who reported they were still searching for housing in late August, Chancellor Yang established a housing task force co-chaired by Kerry Bierman, Associate Vice Chancellor of Budget &amp; Planning, and Mario Muñoz, Associate Director of Residential &amp; Community Living, to explore all possible options, including working with local hotels to provide temporary emergency housing at the same subsidized cost a student would pay for an on-campus double.  
 

To accommodate students who informed the University in late August and September that they still hadn’t secured housing, the University has contracted with local hotels on or near MTD bus lines to make rooms available to students who could not find suitable housing elsewhere for fall quarter. These accommodations are temporary, and are intended to give students more time to find permanent housing or until spaces open up in existing housing.  
 

Through maximizing our housing capacity and contracting with hotels, we have been able to provide housing options for the fall quarter for the students who were still in need of affordable living situations.  
 

We want to thank our colleagues on the housing task force and in Housing, Dining &amp; Auxiliary Enterprises for their commitment to our students and for the assistance they continue to provide in helping them obtain housing. We also want to thank the members of our community who offered rental units to our students.  
 

If any member of our campus community is aware of a UC Santa Barbara student that is without housing, please contact University &amp; Community Housing Services by phone at 805-893-4371 or by email at [housinginfo@housing.ucsb.edu](mailto:housinginfo@housing.ucsb.edu). In addition to support for Housing, students were notified last week about a whole [range of programs to help with basic needs](https://t.e2ma.net/click/jcqfhf/7q1ofom/j0kf0x).

I'm a grad student living at Munger Hall next year. I'm looking for a covered parking spot close by. I've looked at Craigslist and FB, but wanted to try here as well. Ideally, it would be a spot in a house, paved, and covered. Please PM me if you have a spot available.
